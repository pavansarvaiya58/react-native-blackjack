How to Run a React Native Application Using Expo on an Emulator
Install the required dependencies:

-- cd Blackjack
Change to the directory containing the project:

-- npm install
Install the required packages for the project:

Once the installation is complete, run the Expo development server:

-- npm start
This command will open a new browser window displaying the Expo Developer Tools.

OR

-- npm run android
This command will run the application in the android emulator.

In the terminal, you will see a QR code displayed. Scan this QR code using the Expo Go app installed on your physical device.

The React Native application will be installed on your emulator and you can run the application on the emulator.

Note: If you're using a physical device for testing, make sure to scan the QR code with the Expo Go app installed on your device. If you don't have the Expo Go app installed, you can download it from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.

To ensure the React Native application works correctly on your emulator, you can follow these additional steps:

Verify that the React Native development server is running. If not, you can start it using the npm start command.

Check if your emulator or physical device is connected to the same network as your computer. This is important for the Expo development server to communicate with the React Native application running on your emulator or physical device.

Ensure that your emulator or physical device is running the latest version of the Expo Go app.

By following these steps, you can successfully install the necessary dependencies, run the Expo development server, and deploy your React Native application on an emulator or physical device.
